B01M1EEPOB,Apple EarPods with Lightning Connector - White,They're not terrible.,4.0,"To be fair they're better than expected. I wouldn't call them audiophile headphones but I'm the sort of snob who hates graphic equalisers and always resets audio settings in hire cars. I only use them for calls on my laptop, never for listening to music. However, they are surprisingly comfortable and don't fall out. They have decent treble and bass as well as midrange although its all a bit flat and everything gets muddled when there's a lot going on. But don't listen to me, sound is subjective. If you like them don't let anyone tell you you shouldn't. The most important thing is they sound decent, they're well made and if they're not genuine Apple, they are extremely good copies.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 March 2023

B0BCKHQGJN,"Wireless Earbuds, Bluetooth 5.3 Headphones In Ear with 4 ENC Noise Cancelling Mic, Btootos New Bluetooth Earbuds Mini Deep Bass Stereo Sound, 36H Playtime LED Display Wireless Earphones IP7 Waterproof",Great little ear buds,5.0,"I have had a great many pairs of budget Bluetooth ear buds and am yet to have a perfect pair. These sound great and the bass is spot on once you have fitted the correct size ear tip.Problems with other ear buds range from: Latency too high, far behind on lipsync when watching videos. Not loud enough, buds falling out of ears, over sensitive touch controls.I have used these for 2 months now. So what is good.. The sound is up there  with the best budget ear buds I've used. Battery life is adequate (at least I've not had them run out on me yet), though I have not used them constantly for more than about 1.5 hours. I love the battery indicator on the case, not seen on many premium buds. Noise cancelling seems adequate although its difficult to compare as there is no on/off/passthrough modes.Latency is pretty good. So its not perfect and you may notice the slightest of delays on lipsync  but is mostly not noticeable or significant enough to bother you. Latency is a problem for most budget ear buds so pretty happy with this.You have some control with gestures from tapping the side of the ear buds Volume/track skip/pause etc. When you tap you will hear a clicking sound which is very useful in indicating how many taps have been registered from your touches. I love this feature, this helps lower the frustration. It's very easy to tap the wrong part of the earbud and without the click you would be left frustrated as to why the ear bud did not respond to your command. Now you know why. If you didn't hear the click then you tapped the wrong spot on the bud.If I was being picky I would have liked wireless charging or noise cancelling modes on/off/passthrough but I think that is a limit of the chip used in these buds. They are really very good for the price so can't complain.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 26 February 2023

I am happy with sound quality and although the noise cancellation is low, I hear the same thing about a lot of other similar earbuds that cost a lot more anyway. The 3 sizes of ear piece covers is great (I need to experiment with these)- I was able to remove and fix on the new covers by stretching each one slightly so it wasn't too difficult.My only concern was initially not being able to pair with my laptop but after searching some answered questions, the advice given by someone about tapping the buds x5 and returning to their charging case for about 30 seconds worked.

B0BDJ37NF5,Apple AirPods Pro (2nd generation) ​​​​​​​,"Fantastic earphones, although expensive.",4.0,"As an introduction to this review, here is a summary. If you want Airpods and are prepared to pay the cost, these are fantastic. 10/10. No need to read the rest of the review, although you can if you want. For the people who are deciding whether to spend the extra money for the Pros over the regular airpods, this review will hopefully be helpful in decidingThe main difference between the Airpods Pro 2nd gen and the Airpods 3rd gen, is the ear tips. This enables noise cancellation and transparency mode.Transparency mode is honestly a 10/10. Could not be better. When I put them in my ears with transparency mode on, I often forget that they seal off, as they make it feel like I haven't got them in. While playing audio, I can still clearly here if someone is calling my name or something, which is very helpful.Noise cancellation is a 9/10. If you are playing audio while it is on, you basically cannot hear anything unless you are inside a jet engine or something. In a very loud room, it feels silent. Very impressive. I never use them without noise control on, as I find that it feels pressurised and weird in my ears.The sound quality of these is very good for earphones. I am personally a very audio focused person, I record and produce music. For me they do sometimes sound a little tiny, although they are easily the best sounding earphones I have ever heard, by a long shot. Although if you are thinking about over ear headphones, just because of the raw size of them, cheaper over ear headphones will sound better. The spatial audio really elevates the listening experience, when listening to music or watching movies etc. The head tracked spatial audio, however, I find is just a gimmick, although a cool one. I very rarely use it.The Airpods are generally quite comfortable. An 8/10 on comfort. Once I played around a bit with different ear tips sizes, and found the ones that fit me best, I found that I could wear them for about 2 hours continuously until they became uncomfortable. This got better over time as my ears got used to them, so I found little issue with comfort.The Airpods have very pretty good battery life. 8/10. They charge very quickly as well, which is extremely helpful. I find about 4-5 hours with the buds, then about 4 full charges of the buds from the case. I also use the wireless charging regularly, which is helpful. They take about 5 minutes of charging for 1 hour of listening I find.As a Mac and iPhone user, the earphones switch very intuitively between them, based on what I am doing. I find it very useful when I am working, or watching YouTube while playing chess or something random like that. They paired very easily in initial setup also, which was great.The touch controls on the side are very good. They require a bit of pressure on the stems to activate a click. Swipe to change volume I find very helpful, and long press to change between noise cancellation and transparency mode is also great.The case has all the functions of an airtag built in, which is very helpful if lost.You may be wondering, why am I rating these 4/5 stars. It is simply the price. They are very expensive, but I do not regret buying them. The only other reason I mark them down, is that they don't have the raw bass of over ear headphones, even cheaper ones. The main standout feature for me is the noise control features. That's why in my opinion they are worth the upgrade over the 3rd gen Airpods for many people.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 7 March 2023
B0BDJ37NF5,Apple AirPods Pro (2nd generation) ​​​​​​​,Unleashing the Magic of Sound,5.0,"The Apple AirPods Pro 2nd Generation are a remarkable piece of technology that offer an unparalleled audio experience. As soon as you take them out of the box, you can see and feel the premium quality of the design. The earbuds are incredibly comfortable to wear, and the different sizes of silicone ear tips make it easy to find the perfect fit for your ears.One of the standout features of the AirPods Pro is the active noise cancellation. It works flawlessly to block out any external noise, creating a fully immersive audio experience. Whether you're listening to music, taking phone calls, or watching videos, you'll feel completely immersed in the sound.Another impressive feature is the Transparency mode, which allows you to hear the world around you while still listening to your audio. This is particularly useful for when you need to be aware of your surroundings, such as when walking on a busy street or in a crowded area.The AirPods Pro also have an impressive battery life, providing up to 4.5 hours of listening time and 1 hour of talk time on a single charge. The charging case also holds multiple charges, giving you up to 24 hours of battery life in total.Overall, the Apple AirPods Pro 2nd Generation are an exceptional product that deliver on all fronts - sound quality, comfort, and functionality. If you're in the market for a high-quality pair of wireless earbuds, these are definitely worth considering.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 24 February 2023
B0BDJ37NF5,Apple AirPods Pro (2nd generation) ​​​​​​​,WOW..... These are by far the best I have ever owned.,5.0,"I read many recent reviews on these and I was impressed on the outcome. These are by far the best sounding quality ear pods I have ever owned. The sound from these is pure class and they fit into my lobes like a glove (Mine are Large) There's a choice of 4 pairs of covers from (XS, S, M, L) and they are easy to set up and operate. I work in and travel around London and use the underground network daily. These beauty's will drown out any outside noise and as one other reviewer wrote make sure you don't fall asleep wearing these, you certainly won't hear any station announcements. Regardless of your choice of genre, the sounds that these Air Pods Pro 2 produce will surely impress you. The one thing that surprised me though was that Air Pods Pro 2 were cheaper than the Bose in ear pods but the Apple Air pods Pro 2 had a far higher percentage review rate. If you're considering owning a decent pair of ear pods, consider these, they are sublime.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 2 March 2023
B0BDJ37NF5,Apple AirPods Pro (2nd generation) ​​​​​​​,Great!,5.0,"I absolutely love my AirPods Pro second generation! They are a fantastic upgrade from the original AirPods, with so many great new features and improvements.First of all, the sound quality is absolutely amazing. The active noise cancellation works wonders, blocking out all sorts of background noise so that I can truly immerse myself in my music or podcasts. And the transparency mode is incredibly useful too, allowing me to hear what's going on around me without having to take out my earbuds.The fit of the AirPods Pro is also much better than the original AirPods. They come with different ear tips so that you can choose the size that's most comfortable for you, and they stay in my ears much more securely than the first generation.The charging case is also sleek and easy to use, and I love that I can just place my AirPods Pro back in the case to charge them up. Plus, the battery life is great - I can use them for hours without having to worry about running out of juice.Overall, I am absolutely thrilled with my AirPods Pro second generation. They are a top-notch product that I would highly recommend to anyone looking for high-quality wireless earbuds.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 18 February 2023
B0BDJ37NF5,Apple AirPods Pro (2nd generation) ​​​​​​​,Sounds good,5.0,"I have found AirPods the most ergonomic of the earbud offerings and use them for phone (extensively), audiobook and music. There is a lot of emphasis across all kit on display quality for eyes but sound quality can be overlooked. The value of privacy and not disturbing other people means that comfort when used for long periods is also important.I moved up from AirPods to AirPod Pro after finding that the former tended to fall out when walking (regardless of cup fitting) and the greater sound quality was an incidental benefit.The first generation of the Pro have been excellent and I would probably not have upgraded but the holder and pods inside did not survive a cotton hot wash when left in a jeans pocket (don’t try this at home). I tried drying them by putting them in a bowl of rice but no luck.Generation 2 was imminent and I made do with a different make for a month. Although not inexpensive, the stand ins fell well short of AirPods in terms of comfort, staying in the ear, weight and simplicity of use. I had to refer to a manual because the design was not intuitive.AirPod 2 prompted an upgrade to my Iphone OS for full functionality (you can proceed without but don’t benefit from all the enhancements). Once done, pairing completed in seconds and a brief tour popped up explaining ‘on stalk’ controls.There are all sorts of jargon reviews about spatial sound field depth and so on. All I know is that, from recollection after a month’s gap, the sound quality and immersive sense was better. This could be partly the stand ins but I used them far less because they were not up to AirPod user friendliness. I used the pro 1 for a long time and I can identify a material improvement to an already good sound stage. Phone calls and audiobooks are not much of a challenge and to put the new generation through its paces I chose a few tracks that would test out bass, high notes, quiet and wall of sound music. To my ear, these very light earbuds are high quality hi fi and on a par with a Bose unit we use. The difference with the Pro 2 seems to be a sense of openness - more akin to listening to 3D sound versus an enclosed headphone experience.Noise cancellation - good in generation 1, it is dramatic for its ability to negate external sounds in the new incarnation. It also seems to be less artificial. Rather than a cotton wool effect, it is more as if external sounds are removed and that the degree of cancellation in some way takes account of the level of ambient noise rather than a blanket effect.There is no noticeable difference in size, weight or mass of the kit and the stalk seems to be much the same. One change is a further ear cup size, accommodating to a wider range of fitting needs.Most controls (volume, pause, skip) are available on the stalks. I have always found it easier to operate these from the phone and it took a degree of practice to test out ‘stalk control’. It works and may be useful for the gym and running.I think generation 1 AirPods were waterproof but not the charging case. Both are now certified water (rather than splash) proof. I wouldn’t risk them in a long boil wash again but a waterproof case reduces the need to safeguard it when out and about. Not tried them in the shower or swimming and will leave this to anyone prepared to risk new kit in the interests of reviewing.Charging is, as per previously, possible using a charging mat and the spec states markedly improved usage per charge - 6 hours listening/4.5 talk time for the AirPods and 30/24 for the case. Slightly less with spatial audio and head tracking (?! - think ‘cinema surround sound’).Important to note - AirPods can be used with non Mac devices but some of the advanced features are not available, requiring Mac OS.The one phenomenon that I will need to wait and see to know if it has been eliminated is ‘fade’. On all AirPods I have noticed after a while that phone callers report that my voice is fading out (random occurrence) for no accountable reason. I only notice this on calls, not listening and it seemed to be a function of the microphone and software because I could hear the caller fine. It was the only (and intermittent) issue I had with previous versions. I kept software up to date and the only other cause I have read up is ‘too many apps in use). iPhones don’t close apps and I have to periodically swipe and clear a dozen or so. Could be the issue and I have only discovered this as the possible culprit when looking for problems reported on line with generation 2. The only claimed problem was an apparently continued one - connectivity between multiple devices. I haven’t noticed this but I haven’t experienced a problem when switching between my Mac, IPad and phone or a Bluetooth enabled land line phone.And finally. All told I have probably spent 3 hours over the years searching for the case, which can easily get lost in pockets (thus the washing machine incident). The number of times I have been delayed going out or forced to take a call because I had misplaced them is legion. This has been solved by being able to ask the AirPod case to emit a ping to reveal where it is in hiding.Overall. I would have hesitated to buy these if I had not machine washed version 1 and then taken a backward step with another make. However, my subjective impression is that these are a significant step forward for an already good piece of kit. If you use AirPods on a daily basis for a fair while I consider that you will find these worthwhile the upgrade. Plenty are prepared to change smart phones at each launch (I usually wait three years) but to use an analogy, better tyres can improve driving experience for far less outlay than changing a car. AirPods support quite a lot of high end kit and the outlay enhances the overall utility of that ecosphere.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 26 September 2022
B0BDJ37NF5,Apple AirPods Pro (2nd generation) ​​​​​​​,You get what you pay for,5.0,"After many years of using other EarPods I decided to try out Apple, made sense to do so as I have iPhone, iPad and iMac so why not complete the collection!Yea these are expensive. But, in many years of using EarPods at work, while out and about and mainly at the gym I can hand on heart say these are absolutely the next level. This is because;1. Perfect Fit. Apple have done a lot of work on creating a perfect fit. Options of four sizes and coupled with the spatial audio feature you really do get an audio nirvana type of experience.2.Lightweight - to the extent that  as other reviewers have put it, makes you think they are not there.3.Audio -  sound is excellent and you can really turn up the volume without creating distortion.4. ANC - very brilliant. Not only in the gym where I’m not sure I can hear much if any background noise, I used these on a rail journey the other day and the ANC was that good I couldn’t hear the rumble of the train or the announcements. Might be a bit dangerous if you were to fall asleep!! :)5. Connection - with apple to apple this is done automatically. Charging is easy and the charge lasts for a long while-I haven't ran out of charge yet.6. Sweat resistant. The tin says they are and Incan confirm they are - they don’t fall out while I’m on the treadmill doing my 5 k runs!!You will get cheaper versions on the market which if you aren’t to worried about the 6 key things above may suit your needs and pocket better.

B0BDJ37NF5,Apple AirPods Pro (2nd generation) ​​​​​​​,Awesome,5.0,"I recently had to replace my Bose QC30 headphones due to aging parts, and was disappointed in their longevity. After considering options from Sony and Apple, I ultimately chose the AirPods Pro 2 for their seamless integration with my Apple devices. I was pleasantly surprised by the noise cancellation, which is comparable to my previous Bose headphones. Additionally, the AirPods Pro 2 are lightweight and easily portable, making them a great option for travel. The battery life is impressive, providing up to 5 hours of listening time with noise cancellation and spatial audio enabled. To ensure peace of mind, I purchased the 2-year AppleCare+ insurance plan which includes accident coverage and extends the guarantee to 2 years for only 29 pounds. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my decision to purchase the AirPods Pro 2 and would highly recommend them to anyone.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 25 February 2023
B0BDJ37NF5,Apple AirPods Pro (2nd generation) ​​​​​​​,Simply magic,5.0,"I've had the Airpods 3rd gen for about a year and love them so I thought I'd try these and I wasn't disappointed. The Apple airpods are by far the easiest to pair with devices. My first test was on Classic FM. Basses were deep and beautifully clear as was the trebles from the likes of violins, violas, trebles and vocals. It's such a joy listening to music through these. I've just sent back a pair of top end earbuds that came nowhere close to this quality. Watched a movie on my Oculus quest 2 VR last night too and you could hear every breath, squeak and rumble.

B0BDJ37NF5,Apple AirPods Pro (2nd generation) ​​​​​​​,The Best All Rounders Right Now,4.0,"The Apple Air Pods Pro 2 are so good at everything they do that I think they’re the best all rounders for most people. Although they are good or very good in all aspects, other buds have better sound and noise cancelling. The Air Pods Pro 2 do more things better than the competition though. For example, wind noise is a non issue when on calls outdoors. Call quality is also great. Transparency mode is so good it almost feels like you aren’t wearing ear buds and again, wind noise is massively reduced in comparison with other premium ear buds. They are also smaller and lighter (both the case and the buds) than most of the competition. I do notice that you have to ramp the volume up to a very high level to get the best sound but that’s not a problem. The noise cancelling is great but it doesn’t drown out voices or higher pitched sounds too well, which can be an issue with when travelling. In most cases though, it’s very good. Overall, they’re great and probably the best out there right now.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 5 February 2023
B0BDJ37NF5,Apple AirPods Pro (2nd generation) ​​​​​​​,Must have for Apple users,4.0,"The fit of the earbuds is important, a lot depends on them, if you don't want to keep tweaking them, look for one of the earphones on the sidewalk or at home.Everyone's ear is different, so keep this in mind when switching from the default ones to smaller or larger ones. I use factory-fitted headphones and do not need to adjust the headphones, although they could fall out of my ears while cycling.It is worth adding that the set includes a new size (XS) of inserts. It works great if the user has a smaller ear. It is good to check each of the sizes to make them fit perfectly.AirPods Pro last up to 6 hours on a charge, most of the time that's true. It is worth mentioning that the charging case extends the listening time to 30.I have been using the Jabra Elite 7 Pro for a long time, the headphones discharge slower in an hour of listening to music compared to the new AirPods. Not only that, the Apple headphones are constantly charged in the case, even after reaching 100%The case has undergone a slight metamorphosis, there is a place for a lanyard, speaker and microphone. The IPX4 certification has not been forgotten, thanks to which the ""box"" is more resistant to water.Nothing prevents you from controlling the operation of the headphones without using an iPhone. Everything is done by pressing each shaft separately.The gestures are as follows:- single press starts or pauses playback- double pressing changes the track to the next in the queue- triple press changes the track to the previous one in the queue- pressing and holding enables ANC or contact modeThe hallmarks of the AirPods Pro are undoubtedly the contact mode and active noise reduction. Both are important and should be implemented as well as possible.ANC will work when we do not want to hear sounds coming from outside (cars on the street, people talking or inside the plane). Thanks to this, you can focus on listening to your favorite songs.AirPods Pro 2 do a great job of cutting off unwanted sounds. I didn't use the first generation, so it's hard for me to compare them to it, but the ANC fares better when compared to the Jabra Elite 7 Pro.Contact mode is a game changer for me, it works very well. I use it mainly in stores or when withdrawing money from an ATM. In such moments, it is good to hear what is happening around you.Adaptive mode is a novelty available only in the second generation. Its task is to strongly mute louder sounds.Partly this is fine, but sometimes it can work to your disadvantage. Especially when crossing the road, if the car honks and someone does not hear it, there may be a problem ...You can turn it off at any time.I listen to a lot of hip-hop and the sound in AirPods Pro 2 is of the highest quality. The bass is stronger, and the rest is better compared to the Jabras. These are some of the best headphones in this regard.Call quality was improved too, but the headphones had a connection problem and I could use them every other phone if they were to be used for phone calls.The price is not the lowest, but you can see what it is dictated by. Great ANC and contact mode, somewhat questionable battery life and high sound quality justify their cost.Integration with iOS / iPadOS is another plus, you do not need to download an additional application to set the headphones and select the appropriate functions. This is another element that should be watched by the competition.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 17 October 2022
B0BJCTH4NH,"Wireless Earbuds, Wireless Headphones Bluetooth 5.0 Headphones 3D HiFi Stereo Headphones Noise Cancellation in-Ear Built-in Mic with Charging Case, Touch Control Earphones for iphone/Android/IOS",Good Quality and Easy to Use,5.0,"Although I have no previous experience with, or technical knowledge of Bluetooth earbuds, I had no trouble pairing them to the smartphone and computer.On listening to music, voice recordings, audiobooks and videos I was positively surprised at the quality and clarity of the stereo sound.I now use the earbuds mainly when out and about, especially when walking in nature, and in the evenings when relaxing. I also discovered them to be useful when preparing food at home in the kitchen in preference to straining to hear the loudspeakers in the adjacent room.After fully charging the charging box and then using both earbuds together, I found I initially got a little under 2 hours listening time. After that, I found I could usefully let the earbuds charge up from the charging box a couple of times more to give a grand total listening time of a little over 4 ½ hours. Then I would fully recharge the charging box once again.Alternatively, I found I could use one earbud at a time and alternate them to double the total listening time before fully recharging the charging box once again.Because I know very little about noise cancellation technology, I feel I am not qualified to speak about it. However, on the few occasions I was using these earbuds in crowded public places and supermarkets with background noise, I had no trouble listening to my music or recordings. I did hear background noise, but I found in most cases that background noise can be compensated for by switching up the volume. Some exceptions being mainly when walking along some busy main roads with much traffic or walking past loud machinery, possibly in combination with low quality recordings I am listening to.Being unfamiliar with the technology and usage of Bluetooth earbuds, I found the main drawback of my purchase was the small paper strip of instructions that came with the earbuds. I would have liked the instructions to have been more detailed and clearer to help me to get to know the earbuds without sometimes having to resort to trial and error.  I also found the English instructions difficult to read because they are written in very small print.For my purposes I haven’t needed to use, and probably will not use the touch function, especially in combination with making calls, and so I cannot speak about it here.Overall I find that these wireless earbuds definitely fulfil the purpose for which I bought them and I feel they were a bargain for the relatively low price I paid for them.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 March 2023
B0BJCTH4NH,"Wireless Earbuds, Wireless Headphones Bluetooth 5.0 Headphones 3D HiFi Stereo Headphones Noise Cancellation in-Ear Built-in Mic with Charging Case, Touch Control Earphones for iphone/Android/IOS","Sound is decent. Comfortable to wear, but poor battery",4.0,"Never really bothered with noise cancellation features, but so far it gets the job done. I can mostly study free from distractions, though I don't think I've used it in a very noisy environment so far.Sound is pretty decent. I won't say perfect, but most music turns out nice and there is decent bass. However, you have to make sure you hear the in-built voice system says ""pairing"" before attempting to connect to any device, otherwise the quality will be distorted for some unknown reason. Long story short, don't connect the earbuds too quickly (once taken out of the charging shell) to the devices.However, I'm most disappointed with the battery. Granted, I set the volume higher than average, but usage normally lasts 1.5-2 hours. Not sure if its quantitatively shorter than average, but from experience of using various wireless earbuds, this one depletes rather quickly.No issues with fitting into my ears especially since there is no ""rubbery"" component that clogs your ears. The earbuds ""extended leg"" design might be slightly inconvenient when you put a hood over it.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 February 2023

I'm not sure they are worth the full price of £50+, however with the deal these are amazingly impressive for an excellent price.I have an Android phone (Pixel) and was looking for some wireless earbuds that didn't go 'in to' my ear. The Echo Buds are great quality, but they push inside your ear canal, which I don't find comfortable. The Apple AirPods were overpriced and don't give a lot of their functionality on Android, so would be a waste of money. So, based on previous good reviews, I took a chance on these ones, and I have to say I'm very happy and impressed.The cons;- The sound quality is OK. Not fantastic, but not terrible either. I use them at work and on a treadmill, and plan on using them for hikes, and for that purpose the quality is fine and they work well. I listen to both heavy rock and bass-heavy music, and they sound perfectly acceptable with either, just not amazing.- The don't come with any accessories (bar the charging case and a cable). For hiking/jogging purposes, I like to use the little rubber upwards-facing tips that slip over earbuds to help secure them in your ear. These didn't come with any and if you do use them (I already had some from an old pair of earbuds) then you will have to remove them to place the earbuds back in the charging case.- Sometimes adjusting the earbuds in your ear accidently triggers a control, such as restarting a trackThe pros;- The charging case is great, it's compact, sleek and good looking. Fits in my pocket nicely. The display on the front is a nice touch.- It's USB-C charged and comes with a cable- They sit comfortably in my ears for hours- The battery only goes down about 10% per hour- The controls on them are surprisingly good; touch once on either earbud for volume control, twice for track jumping, and the option to control Siri if you have an iPhoneOverall, would I recommend them?

If compared to the established fruity market leader, they are not quite as good but still more than acceptable. They don't stay in my ears on their own but I have silicon earhooks (search for them on Amazon, they will change your life) which I use that hold them in the ear perfectly. I don't consider this to be a failing of these particular buds as I've had the same issues with others. Maybe I have weird ears.The comments from other people about the case being too ""slippy"" are valid. Opening the case and retrieving the buds isn't always ergonomic and often the lid snaps shut accidentally which can be annoying. Also I've noticed that quite often only one earbud will automatically pair with my Steam Deck but this happens most if the buds are activated (by opening the case) before the Steam Deck is switched on. I guess the trick is to have the paired device ready before popping open the lid....That certainly helped for me anyway.Despite those issues I would still recommend these earbuds if you don't want to pay premium prices and you're willing to put up with some minor annoyances.

 I bought these because I couldn't afford a fancy branded make so I wasn't expecting much from them. I was pleasantly surprised at how good they are, the second you open the case they start connecting to your phone, by the time you've got one in your ear they're already connected!They're nice and small and lightweight so they actually stay in my ears, I've gone on lots of runs now to test them out (treadmill and cross country in the rain) and they've not budged. The sound quality is way better than expected too and the controls are easy to grasp.There isn't a great deal of noise cancellation but that's not really a big issue for me as I'm often running near a road and need to keep my ears open for traffic.Lastly they look nice, slim, black with chrome and the case seems well made.For under £20 I really can't complain, I don't know how long they'll last but when I loose one (which let's face it I will do eventually) I will definitely re-purchase them.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 6 March 2023

Problem is they are quite bulky, difficult to get out of the charging case, frequently unpair or shut down necessitating fiddling about, switching on and off etc to get them working again, and most importantly right now - left at home when packing for an extended period of working away.I decided to buy this pair not expecting miracles but something that would suffice as entertainment on my daily walk and for £19 how could I go wrong.What I was not expecting was the sound quality, which to my ear, is absolutely fine, and the ease of use - they pair immediately, stay paired, respond quickly to changing volume and track and are generally an absolute pleasure to use.No more fiddling about trying to get them out of the case either. Not quite sure how bigger, more masculine fingers might manage but definitely much easier than my now defunct pair which will probably just stay in their case from now on.I am happy with this purchase.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 10 February 2023

Unlike my last pair, they charge with a USB-C cable (USB-A to C cable is provided), but better still, they take a rapid charge USB-C too. Wireless charging would be lovely, but would come at a cost.The buds are so light, small and fit really comfortably (in my ear at least).They pair very rapidly (don’t ask me what Bluetooth 5.3 is, my devices aren’t 5.3 so it doesn’t matter either), the controls seem fairly intuitive; pause, reverse, skip all with one, two or three quick taps.Sound is a little light in the bass department, however, nothing at this price is going to excel here.There are a million ‘cheap’ wireless buds out there.

B07J2Z5DBM,TOZO T10 Bluetooth 5.3 Earbuds True Wireless Stereo Earphones Headphones IPX8 Waterproof in Ear Wireless Charging Case Built in Mic Headset Premium Sound with Deep Bass for Running Sport Black,Exercise Just Got Enjoyable,5.0,"I had been looking for a pair of wireless earphones as I had experienced so much trouble with trying to wear my old wired ones on runs. They would bounce around and affect the sound, get tugged out of my ears altogether by the wires catching, and even get damaged by all the incessant tugging. I decided I had to have wireless earphones or I just couldn't run as I need music to keep me going!I bought these TOZO T10 Bluetooth Earbuds as they sounded to be appropriate for my uses, as well as more affordable than some other options out there, and I am pleased to announce that these earphones are everything they claim to be! The sound quality is very good, and other noises are cancelled right out. The design is very sleek and smooth, and the buds fit comfortably in your ears.The box comes with lots of different-sized extra buds to swap and switch as well in case your ears don't fit the default buds! I will say though that I tried changing the buds experimentally when I first got the earphones, but the default ones just would not come off no matter how much I pulled and tugged! Luckily the default ones fitted my ears anyway, but it could cause issues for those who don't fit that size.Also, I have had problems with the controls for skipping, rewinding, pausing, and volume. They are a little tricky to get the hang of, and so many times now I have paused a song I meant to skip or skipped a song I meant to increase the volume of! Still, I do find it very convenient to have all the controls integrated into the earphones themselves. I'm sure with practise I'll get the feel of it better too!There is much more good about these earphones than bad though. They are quite water-resistant, for one - I can sweat a lot while running, so they do get wet, yet they still sound great. They also don't seem to slip out at all no matter how sweaty my ears get, nor how much I bounce while running! They really do seem to be perfect to exercise with.I have not had as much luck trying to voice-call with them, though. Outside of exercise, I have attempted to have a call with my boyfriend before while wearing these earphones, and although the microphone worked fine he still found it very hard to hear me. Therefore I would say that these earphones are best as listening-only, and would not recommend them to anyone who wants earphones for voice-calls.The battery life is by far the most incredible thing about these earphones! They arrive in the case pre-charged, and I can tell you that I have not needed to charge the case even once since I bought them last autumn (it is now spring). Now, I have not yet used the buds a great amount forr running; but even so, I did use one of the buds at work once - it played music non-stop for the entire eight-hour shift, and the case still has not needed to be re-charged after I charged the bud back up in it.These earphones have changed my life quite literally. Exercise used to be absolutely miserable, but now it is a delight! I can finally achieve my fitness goals, and it is all thanks to my trusty little TOZO T10's. It is also nice to have a wireless option for when I want to listen to music discreetly at work, or at home while busy cooking or cleaning. I love my new earphones!",Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 10 February 2023

The set up was very straight forward and connected to my devices bluetooth in a few seconds. When you pick the earbuds up out of the case they automatically attach to each other and have useful light indicators. The case also has light indicators to show the charge level which is very helpful.The waterproof feature is very useful as I'm often worried about headphones if it is raining etc.They fit in my ear nicely and don't fall out as there is a selection of attachment earpiece sizes to best fit the size of your ear.Nice presentation in the box and good clear instructions.The sound is really nice, I have listened to a selection of songs and audiobooks etc and the sound is up there with some of the best sounding earbuds I've used, very clear with good sound range / overall levels and I'd definitely recommend them!The sound range distance is good, I walked downstairs in my home and continued to listen to the headphones no problem (under 10 metres).The case and earbuds feel very premium, there is even a lanyard included for carrying around your neck or hanging on a hook etc.For the price you can't go wrong, also supports wireless charging which I might have to try out as well!I've added an unboxing video plus some photos to help show what's included too.Thanks for reading my review and hopefully this might've helped in your decision to try out these brilliant headphones if you do decide to get these.

Noise cancellation during phone calls works best with traffic sounds, doesn't work well in closed places especially if noise is human voices. Often distant voices can be heard on the other side louder than the wearer's voice. Also, if it's windy it will create noise both for the caller and the listener on the other side. But for this price and type of technology it would be unrealistic to expect pristine outdoor phone calls (these are simply too small and the microphone will necessarily far away from the mouth).

B07J2Z5DBM,TOZO T10 Bluetooth 5.3 Earbuds True Wireless Stereo Earphones Headphones IPX8 Waterproof in Ear Wireless Charging Case Built in Mic Headset Premium Sound with Deep Bass for Running Sport Black,It's not about the brand.,5.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 After considering the reviews, this one is a good choice to me so far. Both earbuds has different functions when playing music. The Right ⬆️ volume, Left ⬇️ volume. The left rewinds and the right skips or play forward. Both earbuds are touch sensors. The sound quality especially the bass is surprisingly better than any other earphones I used to have had. And it's a noise cancellation as well.Receiving and ending calls has never been the same as both has the same functions which make it far better than any other earphones out there. Voice quality from callers is more or less the same from the others.It is by far the best earphones with the best price in the market. I'm sure after this reviews, other companies will try to consider theirs one.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 15 February 2023
B07J2Z5DBM,TOZO T10 Bluetooth 5.3 Earbuds True Wireless Stereo Earphones Headphones IPX8 Waterproof in Ear Wireless Charging Case Built in Mic Headset Premium Sound with Deep Bass for Running Sport Black,Long lasting battery and good sound quality at a small price,4.0,"I was looking for a pair of wireless earbuds to workout in the gym, as my previous ones broke down suddenly. After having seen many products and read a lot of descriptions and reviews, I went for these Tozo T10, as they seemed to tick various boxes, even if they were not the latest model.After having used them for a few months, I can confirm that the life battery is extremely satisfactory. I used to use them every day, for a couple of hours each time, and they could run for the entire week without being charged. The case has four led which show the battery level and they are quite reliable. They also charge quickly.The sound quality is very good, for an item of this price. Bass, middle and high are well balanced and the volume can be easily set. Obviously you cannot expect the quality which studio headphones can offer, but they can compete with much more expensive earbuds.I can also confirm that the are water resistant. I used them in the shower on some occasions and they work pretty well.However, there are a couple of drawbacks. First of all, regardless of the silicone ear tips used, these earbuds do not stay in my ears. I have tried with all the sizes available, but without success. This may depend on my ears, as I have read that the vast majority of users has been able to find a good solution for their needs.The following aspect which is not totally satisfactory in my opinion is relating to the remote control. It might be due to the fact that these earbuds are quite small, but I have found not so easy to change song, skipping a track or going back to another. Therefore, when needed, I preferred doing it by using my device directly, instead of trying by clicking on the earbuds.Finally, the touch control is extremely sensible, hence it is sufficient to touch it lightly to stop the sound.I have not used them to do phone calls, so I cannot rate them in this regards.Although I am not using them anymore in the gym, sometimes I use them as an alternative to my main headphones, when I am charging the latter, to watch videos or listening to music when I am at home.In conclusion, if you are looking for a good pair of earbuds and your ears match with the average size of silicone ear tips, these Tozo T10 are definitely worth the money.Finally, regarding the delivery service, Amazon was impeccable, as usual. The package was delivered very quickly, on time and securely.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 1 November 2022

I took a chance and purchased the air pods and the depth and quality of sound is astonishing. What an amazing advancement from my 36 inch whoofer and tweeter radiogram in the 60’s. I did find it took a few nights to find the perfect place in my ear for the pod to fit and most nights they stay in place so I am asleep without any discomfort of a head set with cord wrapped around my head as I shuffle around.

B0BSBTRQN7,"Wireless Earbuds Bluetooth, IPX7 Waterproof Wireless Earphones Touch Control, 24H Playtime with Fast Charging Case for iPhone/Airpods/Android/Samsung",Disappointing (with updates),1.0,"The monitor broke after 2 days of use. It now flickers every 6.5 seconds. I swapped cables and ports. No avail. Plugged different computers into it. Same result. So I submitted an online support ticket to LG.Let me say this: bad things happen. I’m not overly irritated the monitor broke. No production process is flawless and duds will happen. My concern is LG’s support process.I received it on Friday. It started malfunctioning on Sunday.I submitted the online support request Sunday night and received an automated email almost immediately. The closing line is “We will call you as soon as possible.” Note that word: “call.”Monday I received an email from “Arianne” reiterating the ticket number, informing me to look for additional correspondence with shipping labels, offering condolences, and providing links to create support requests. As an IT professional, I hate these emails. All of that could have been accomplished in the automated response. Additionally, since I have created the ticket which kicked off this process, I don’t need instructions or links to accomplish what I’ve already successfully done. These emails are designed to placate the individual and provide a “human touch.” I find them condescending and superfluous.Tuesday night I received the shipping label and instructions to arrange a FedEx pick up.FedEx picked up the monitor Saturday.Keep in mind, it has now been 7 days and there has been no mention of when I will receive a replacement, and no actual contact with any support professional, no troubleshooting, and no “call.”So I called them.I asked for an estimate on when I can expect a replacement. I am informed that it is under warranty (duh, it broke after 2 days). But the warranty is a repair or replace warranty. So they have 10 business days from the time they receive it to attempt repairs. It could take as little as a “couple of days” if it’s an easy fix. If they determine it’s not repairable or cost effective to repair, I will receive a replacement or a refund. I am also told to allow 3-4 days shipping each way. For those keeping count, that means 3-4 days to them, 10 business days for assessment and repair (which will include at least 1 weekend), and 3-4 days return trip. I paid for a monitor, got 2 days of use out of it, and won’t have it back in working fashion for up to 20 days if all goes well. If all does not go well, I will wait a full month for a monitor I already paid for, and then be given a refund, purchase a replacement, wait another week for delivery, and hope this process does not repeat.When I spend a few hundred dollars on something, I expect it to work. If it happens to be faulty, I expect a PROMPT replacement. Nothing about this has been prompt thus far, and they are promising more of the same. And don’t tell me you’re going to call and then make me have to reach out to you a full week later.At this point I hope it becomes a refund scenario because I am not overjoyed at the prospect of doing business with LG in the future.**First update**Last week I called LG support again since they still seem unable to contact me and provide any guidance or information. I was told the monitor was still in transit.**Second update**It is now May 17th (14 days since I submitted the support request)I called the support number to day for an update. The support person tells me the repair team has not received the monitor yet, but he will follow up and have someone contact me. He advises me to expect a phone call and that I should ""keep my line clear."" He also took down my email address because they will send out ""periodic updates of repair progress."" That part is concerning since that information is already in the system with the repair tick (what they refer to as an RNN number). I have not received any call or email yet. Meanwhile, my repair status is still ""Appointment Confirmation"" which is the same status it has been in since I submitted the request 2 weeks ago.**Third Update**It's May 31st. They still list my monitor as being in repair status. Since my last update I have had contact with them twice. The first was when they called me to due to me filing a complaint on their website. All that person did was reiterate this is their standard support process. He took down my number and email address and informed me they would update me periodically throughout the process. To date, that call is the only contact they have initiated. I have received no updates in any format without reaching out to them myself. I called them again on the 26th to get a progress update and spoke to someone who told me it had not yet been repaired and parts had been ordered. He told me to expect the monitor between the 27th and the 31st. Seeing as how the ticket shows it still hasn't been repaired (and the date of this update), we can all guess how accurate that information was.**Fourth Update**June 1st.  It has now been 29 days since the support request was submitted.I called again today since yesterday was the deadline for  them to complete repair, replacement, or refund. I am being told the repair facility is waiting on parts which will not be available until next week. I requested they escalate the call to a manager since they are now in violation of their own terms, which they have explained to me each time I have reached out for updates. The response I was given is that they will transfer the call but I will be provided the same information. I reiterate they are past their own deadline and this is unacceptable. I clearly state there needs to be a resolution today and I need to be transferred to someone who can make that happen. He says please hold. I have been on hold for half an hour.**Fifth Update**June 1st update part 2. After being on hold for just over an hour, I spoke to a woman who explained the following to me:1. They should have never given me turnaround times. They are not supposed to set those expectations because they cannot guarantee them.2. She will initiate the refund/replacement process for me, but can't do it herself. She has to send an email to the repair department (Elizabeth) because they are the only ones who can initiate a replacement or refund request. She will send the email off instructing (asking?) them to initiate a replacement or refund request and call me back in ""a few days"" to ""let me know what they say.""3. The parts needed to repair my monitor are on back order.So for those keeping score, I am still losing. My current status is that the department that has failed me repeatedly are apparently the only ones who can resolve the issue. I should basically just kiss my $406.59 goodbye. I have utilized the ""Email the President"" feature on the LG website but I am not holding my breath. In short, while I like LG products and have purchased numerous over the years, their support system is the worst I have ever encountered and I will not purchase any of their products in the future.**Sixth Update**June 8th. No one ever called me back as promised back on June 1st. The monitor simply showed up at my door yesterday (not a replacement or refund as indicated on the 1st, but the original monitor...supposedly repaired). I bit my tongue and set it up. It seemed to work fine last night. This morning, however, it is back to flickering...but now every 3 seconds. So the monitor is worse than when I sent it in. I called LG support and they said in this scenario they would ask that I send the monitor back to them for additional repairs. I refused and said I want my money back. Now I'm on hold again to speak with someone from ""executive support.""**7th Update**After speaking with ""executive support"" on the 8th, I was told they were going to submit a request for a refund and someone would call me back on the 10th or 11th. It is now the 14th and I have heard nothing, so I called LG support again and was immediately informed by the gentleman who answered the phone that no request has been processed. So I'm on hold (again) for ""executive support."" This has moved from agonizingly frustrating to downright unacceptable and bordering on theft.**8th update**After a brief hold I spoke to a woman who said she needed to put me on hold to track down a co-worker (presumably the guy I spoke to last week). 5 minutes later she came back on the line and gave the same initial greeting. I told her I was still waiting for her to track down the co-worker and she hung up on me.**9th Update**Called back and spoke to someone from the executive support/services team who says the following:1. The refund request was not submitted last week because their is a chance it could get rejected. So I have been waiting for a week on a callback to update me on the status of something they never actually did.2. Their policy is that they get TWO repair chances before a refund can be considered.3. They can submit the refund request but there is a chance it could get rejected because I have not allowed them a second chance at repairs.As of this writing, I have reached out to them twice via the message the president feature (which I received only one response to). That person said they were my case manager and I haven't heard from them since. I have reached out via Twitter with no response yet. I have tracked them down by phone on a regular basis because no one ever follows up as they promise. And now I know they don't call me back because they don't take the actions they tell me they will, and if I don't call them I'll never know that I'm sitting with a broken monitor that no one wants to deal with.This is not ""customer support.""**10th update**Charlie from LG is now my case manager. According to him, the refund request has been submitted which goes to someone higher up for review. That takes 7-10 business days (sound familiar?). If it is approved, I can expect a refund in 4-6 weeks (mid August). If it is rejected, I have to send the monitor in again, and if all works as it previously did, I'll get it back sometime in mid August...and maybe it works, maybe it doesn't.So lose/lose.**11th update**June 26th.Yesterday (the 25th) was the 10th business day (7-10 business days to review a refund request). I reached out to Charlie by responding to the text message he sent me on the 14th. Here is Charlie's original text to me:""This is Charlie from LG following up with you regarding your case. I will be your case manager until this is resolved. I will be sending you updates on your case. You do not need to call into customer service. Please reach out to me directly if you have any questions or concerns and I will respond promptly.""Is anyone surprised I have received no updates regarding my case? Is anyone surprised that I got no response to my inquiry yesterday? Me neither.The saga continues.**12th update**July 26thHaven't updated this in a while because, frankly, I just thought I was over it. Turns out, I'm not.My refund request was denied because I have to give them two repair attempts. So I sent it back.It arrived on my doorstep today. No updates or notifications since I sent it back to them, and the case tracker says repairs haven't even been started. But it's on my doorstep...with no power cable.I called in and explained the issue. I got put on hold while the rep ""went off to see what he can find out."" He came back and told me he sent this to someone above him and that person will review and get back to me. I asked for an ETA. He said he can't tell me ""when they will have time to reach out."" I told him that was unacceptable and he hung up on me.**13th update**July 30thSo I spent two days calling the executive management hotline and they are apparently no longer taking my calls. I pulled the number for the repair facility off some shipping labels and called them (NOT LG by the way...they outsource repairs). That rep told me they had a ticket for me to return the monitor for a third attempt at repairs. I explained that it was returned to me without a power cable, and that I did not know if it needed repairs because I cannot plug it in to check. She then closed the return request and arranged to ship me a power cable. Today I received a text message from the Executive Support number. It states: ""Our service records show that you recently spoke directly with an LG Presidential Liaison, is that correct? Please kindly select a number to let us know. 1) Yes 2) No"" I have NOT spoken to any presidential liaison and responded accordingly. I have no idea at this point what that question and response will or won't lead to. The power cable arrived today, and at this point it appears the monitor may be functioning properly. I'll leave it running and reverify tomorrow since the issue has never presented immediately.At this point I should mention the guy who hung up on me on the 26th told me, ""sir, we are doing our best to help you.""I really hope my experience is NOT what LG considers to be their best.**14th Update**August 6thI can now confirm the monitor is finally working. I have been using it for just over a week now and the flickering has not returned. There has been no contact from LG since they sent the missing power cable, and no follow-up to the previously mentioned text wherein they were ""confirming"" I had spoken to some mystery liaison (which never happened). And to be blunt, I am not calling to let them know they finally fixed it because, as I think we all can agree, they don't really care.So, in summary, beware of LG support. It took over 3 months and ridiculous amounts of frustration to get a broken device repaired.Toodles.",Reviewed in the United States on 9 May 2021
